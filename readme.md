Simulation of the Millikan Oil experiment created in Unity3D for high school physics culminating project.

The idea of the experiment was to have two charged plates, top and bottom with a hole in the top. Charged oil drops were then allowed 
to fall through the top hole, and by adjusting the voltage of the plates it was possible to suspend some of the oil drops between them.

At the point where an oil drop is suspended, the force of gravity on it is exactly equal to the upward force generated from the electric field.

Fg = Fe
mg = qE

The mass o the oil drop, the acceleration due to gravity, and the Electric field applied on it were all known, therefore it was easy to solve for q, the charge.

Millikans experiment found that all the drops had a q value with multiples of the elementary charge 1.6E-19 Coulombs.
